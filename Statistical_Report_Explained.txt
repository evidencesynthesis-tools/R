  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS REPORT (Methodological Summary)
=================================================================

1. LANGUAGE vs WORKFLOW ASSOCIATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A Chi-Square Test of Independence was performed to evaluate the
association between programming language and workflow stage.

  - Sample Size (N): 277
  - Chi-Square Statistic (X²): 122.37
  - Degrees of Freedom (df): 48
  - P-Value: < 0.001

Interpretation:
  A statistically significant association was observed between programming language and workflow stage (p < 0.001).
  Effect Size (Cramer's V): 0.332 . This represents a medium association.

2. TEMPORAL TREND ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Poisson regression was utilized to model the annual incidence of new tools.
To avoid bias from incomplete yearly data, the year 2026 was excluded
from the regression model (data collection ceased February 2026).

Year Attribution:
  The year assigned to each tool corresponds to the year of its first
  associated research publication. In cases where an original
  publication year could not be identified, the publication year of
  the most recent citable version of the software was used as a proxy.
  This approach ensured consistent temporal classification while
  minimizing missing data.

  Although publication year may not perfectly represent the initial
  release date of the software, it provides a standardized and
  reproducible temporal reference for longitudinal analysis.

  - Modeling Period: 2000 – 2025
  - Model Type: Quasi-Poisson (Robust SE)
  - Dispersion Statistic: 2.203

Trend Description:
  The annual output increased from 1 tools in 2000 to 24 tools in 2025.

Interpretation:
  - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR): 1.158
  - 95% Confidence Interval: [ 1.119 ,  1.198 ]
  Because the confidence interval does not include 1.0, the upward
  temporal trend is statistically significant.

3. MARKET STRUCTURE (OSS vs Proprietary)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A comparative analysis of the verified OSS dataset (n=277) against the
identified proprietary sample (n=90) revealed a distinct architectural
dichotomy.

Contingency Table:
  - OSS Modular: 275 | OSS Integrated: 2
  - Proprietary Modular: 56 | Proprietary Integrated: 34

Descriptive Interpretation:
  The analysis highlights a significant 'Modularity Gap' in the OSS ecosystem.
  While integrated platforms constituted 37.8% (n=34) of the identified proprietary tools, they represented only 0.7% (n=2) of the open-source tools.
  Conversely, 99.3% (n=275) of OSS tools were classified as modular libraries, compared to 62.2% (n=56) of proprietary tools.

4. EXCLUSION CRITERIA
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  Total Records Screened: 624
  OSS Tools Included (Final Analysis): 277
  Tools Excluded: 347

Primary reasons for exclusion:
  - Database                      : 10 (2.9%)
  - Irrelevant Domain             : 70 (20.2%)
  - Non-Software (Guide/Framework): 74 (21.3%)
  - Other (Prototype/Abandoned)   : 103 (29.7%)
  - Proprietary Software          : 56 (16.1%)
  - SaaS/Service                  : 34 (9.8%)
